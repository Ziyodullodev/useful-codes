offer you a chance to explain your actions.

required any explanation.

to obey my orders.

You think you do, but you do not.

You are here

You were told to come here,

And soon it does not matter.

Soon the why and the reason are gone...

709

710
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:40,513
And this is the nature of the universe.

We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

We are forever slaves to it.

717
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:17,467
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

718
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:21,054
"Why" is what separates us from them...

1032
01:49:31,982 --> 01:49:35,150
Trinity, l got some serious activity
headed your way.

1033
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:28,829
Hello, Neo.

1034
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:33,167
-Who are you?
-l am the Architect.

1035
01:50:33,335 --> 01:50:36,962
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1036
01:50:37,213 --> 01:50:41,383
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...

1037
01:50:41,551 --> 01:50:43,552
...you remain irrevocably human.

1038
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,306
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1039
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:51,769
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1040
01:50:51,936 --> 01:50:55,648
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1041
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:58,150
Why am l here?

1042
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:02,237
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1043
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:04,740
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1044
01:51:04,908 --> 01:51:08,994
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1045
01:51:09,162 --> 01:51:11,997
...l've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1046
01:51:12,165 --> 01:51:16,627
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1047
01:51:16,961 --> 01:51:19,296
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1048
01:51:19,464 --> 01:51:23,926
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1049
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:28,055
...which has led you, inexorably...

1050
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:30,265
...here.

1051
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:34,520
-You haven't answered my question.
-Quite right.

1052
01:51:34,688 --> 01:51:38,482
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1053
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:41,276
NEOS: Others? How many?
What others?

1054
01:51:41,444 --> 01:51:43,946
The Matrix is older than you know.

1055
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:48,117
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1056
01:51:48,284 --> 01:51:50,536
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1057
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:53,163
NEOS: Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.

1058
01:51:53,331 --> 01:51:56,875
There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.

1059
01:51:57,043 --> 01:51:58,335
Either no one told me...

1060
01:51:59,587 --> 01:52:03,590
-...or no one knows.
-Precisely.

1061
01:52:03,758 --> 01:52:07,052
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1062
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:10,639
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1063
01:52:10,807 --> 01:52:14,059
You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!

l'm gonna fucking kill you!

1065
01:52:16,187 --> 01:52:19,356
You can't make me do anything.

1067
01:52:23,319 --> 01:52:25,154
The problem is choice.

[ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]

1069
01:52:47,385 --> 01:52:51,013
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1070
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:53,015
Flawless, sublime.

1071
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:56,685
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1072
01:52:57,353 --> 01:52:59,772
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1073
01:52:59,939 --> 01:53:03,275
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1074
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:06,403
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1075
01:53:06,571 --> 01:53:10,574
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1076
01:53:11,284 --> 01:53:15,037
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1077
01:53:16,498 --> 01:53:19,124
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1078
01:53:19,292 --> 01:53:21,335
...because it required a lesser mind.

1079
01:53:21,503 --> 01:53:27,466
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1080
01:53:27,884 --> 01:53:32,304
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1081
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:37,267
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1082
01:53:37,435 --> 01:53:43,398
If l am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

-The Oracle.
-Please.

1084
01:53:47,028 --> 01:53:51,031
As l was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...

1085
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:54,076
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

1086
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:58,372
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1087
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:01,959
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1088
01:54:02,126 --> 01:54:06,129
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1089
01:54:06,297 --> 01:54:09,007
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1090
01:54:09,384 --> 01:54:13,512
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1091
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:17,766
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1092

This is about Zion.

1093
01:54:20,186 --> 01:54:23,856
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1094

Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1095
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:29,778
Bullshit.

1096
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:33,115
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1097
01:54:33,324 --> 01:54:39,788
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1098
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:43,959
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1099
01:54:56,681 --> 01:54:57,973
The function of the One...

1100
01:54:58,141 --> 01:55:02,811
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...

1101
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:04,688
...reinserting the prime program.

1102

from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1103
01:55:09,444 --> 01:55:12,696
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1104
01:55:12,864 --> 01:55:17,409
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1105
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:19,912
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1106
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:22,664
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1107
01:55:22,832 --> 01:55:27,044
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1108
01:55:27,378 --> 01:55:31,465
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1109

There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1110
01:55:36,054 --> 01:55:38,847
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1111

...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

It is interesting reading your reactions.

1113
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:56,490
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1114
01:55:56,658 --> 01:56:01,119
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

1115

...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

While the others experience this
in a general way...

1117
01:56:07,543 --> 01:56:10,504

...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

02:04:28,669 --> 02:04:30,378
Let's go, Morpheus.

1187
02:04:31,797 --> 02:04:34,841
-We won't make it.
-We have to try.

1188
02:04:42,558 --> 02:04:45,560
-Come on!
-Something's different.

1189
02:04:45,728 --> 02:04:47,729
What?

1190
02:04:48,397 --> 02:04:49,898
I can feel them.

1191
02:05:12,838 --> 02:05:14,422
Neo!

1192
02:05:20,596 --> 02:05:24,182
-What happened?
-l don't know.

He's in some kind of coma...

1196
02:05:45,913 --> 02:05:48,164
...but his vitals are stable.

1197
02:05:49,375 --> 02:05:51,292
What about you?

1198
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:53,586
I'm fine.

1199
02:05:53,754 --> 02:05:56,130
You could use some rest.

1200
02:05:56,298 --> 02:05:58,132
No, l'm gonna stay with him.

1201
02:06:05,224 --> 02:06:07,850
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1202
02:06:08,018 --> 02:06:10,895
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1203
02:06:11,063 --> 02:06:13,815
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1204
02:06:14,066 --> 02:06:17,485
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1205
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:20,363
...until someone screwed it up.

1206
02:06:20,531 --> 02:06:23,157
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

When the machines broke through...

1209

...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1210
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:33,543
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1211
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:36,170
-No one knows.
-Someone does.

1212
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:38,089
Who?

1213
02:06:38,257 --> 02:06:41,968
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1214
02:06:42,136 --> 02:06:44,429
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1215
02:06:44,638 --> 02:06:45,722
You found one?

1216
02:06:47,474 --> 02:06:49,183
Only one.

I see the end coming.

02:16:52,913 --> 02:16:56,707
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.

Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1222
02:17:02,005 --> 02:17:04,006

You are all that stands in his way.

If you cannot stop him tonight,
then I fear that tomorrow may never come.
